slidePIN - Powerpoint PIN Entry Application
This little Powerpoint application is inspired by Tom Wildenhain and the lecture Great Impractical Ideas in Computer Science: PowerPoint Programming he gave at CMU. (Link to Youtube-Recording). Because it is a cool and simple way to demonstrate logic as a key component of software and programming, I thought I might release it as teaching tool to be modified and used by others.
